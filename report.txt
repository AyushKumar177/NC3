Problem Statement : 
Develop a chatbot that serves as an expert in a specific domain, 
capable of answering complex queries and explaining concepts. 
Use the arXiv dataset ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv) 
for scientific papers in various fields. 
Train the chatbot on a specific subset of the arXiv dataset (e.g., computer science). 
Implement advanced NLP techniques for information extraction, summarization, and 
user open source LLM for explanation generation. 
Expected Outcome: A chatbot that can discuss advanced topics in the chosen field, 
provide summaries of research papers, and explain complex concepts. 
Ability to handle follow-up questions on complex topics. 
Implement using Streamlit with features for paper searching and concept visualization

Overview
This project aims to develop a chatbot that excels in handling complex queries and providing explanations in a specific domain, using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot will leverage a subset of the arXiv dataset, specifically focusing on computer science papers, to provide detailed information, summaries, and explanations of research topics.

Key Components
Data Preparation:

Source: The arXiv dataset from Kaggle, focusing on computer science papers.
Process: Data is loaded from JSON files, and each document is parsed to extract relevant information such as titles and abstracts.
Vector Database Creation:

Purpose: Create a vector store for efficient retrieval of relevant documents.
Tools:
HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings: For generating embeddings of the documents.
FAISS: To create and manage the vector store.
Language Model Integration:

Model: Google Gemini Pro.
Function: Generate responses based on the context and question provided. The model is accessed via the Google Generative AI API.
Prompt Template Design:

Purpose: Structure the interaction between the chatbot and the user.
Template: Includes context and question, guiding the model to generate precise and contextually relevant answers.
RetrievalQA Chain:

Components:
Retriever: Uses FAISS to fetch relevant documents based on user queries.
LLM (Language Model): Generates answers and explanations.
Function: Handles queries, retrieves relevant documents, and generates responses using the integrated model and prompt template.
Chatbot Functions:

Information Retrieval: Provides comprehensive information about a topic.
Summary Generation: Summarizes content in 50 words.
Detailed Explanation: Offers in-depth explanations of complex concepts.
Error Handling:

Basic error handling to manage issues during response generation.

Expected Outcome
Functionality: The chatbot should be able to:

Discuss advanced topics in computer science.
Provide concise summaries of research papers.
Explain complex concepts in detail.
Handle follow-up questions and engage in detailed discussions.
Interface: The chatbot will be implemented using Streamlit to provide an interactive web-based interface. Features will include:

Paper search functionality.
Concept visualization tools.
Future Improvements
Performance Evaluation: Implement metrics to evaluate response quality and relevance.
User Interface Enhancements: Develop a more user-friendly interface with advanced visualization options.
Integration with Additional Datasets: Expand the chatbotâ€™s knowledge base by integrating other relevant datasets.
