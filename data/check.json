{"title":"Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources:\n  Part I","abstract":"  The intelligent acoustic emission locator is described in Part I, while Part\nII discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two\nsimultaneously active continuous acoustic emission sources.\n  The location of acoustic emission on complicated aircraft frame structures is\na difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes an\nintelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises\na sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the\nlocation problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was\ntested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of\nlocation depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the\ndimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location\naccuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by\nthe conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the\nintelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is\navoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft\nframe structures by the acoustic emission method.\n"}
{"title":"Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources:\n  Part II","abstract":"  Part I describes an intelligent acoustic emission locator, while Part II\ndiscusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two\ncontinuous acoustic emission sources.\n  Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of\ndeveloping defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various\nstatistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is\nseparation and characterization of signal components when the signals from\nvarious sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source\nseparation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve\nthese problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability\nof ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission\nsources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for\nnon-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission\nanalysis.\n"}
{"title":"The World as Evolving Information","abstract":"  This paper discusses the benefits of describing the world as information,\nespecially in the study of the evolution of life and cognition. Traditional\nstudies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and\ncognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the\nphysical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition,\nare described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently\nas information becoming more complex.\n  The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple\nscales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic,\npsychological, philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further used\nto discuss the notions of life, cognition and their evolution.\n"}
{"title":"Learning from compressed observations","abstract":"  The problem of statistical learning is to construct a predictor of a random\nvariable $Y$ as a function of a related random variable $X$ on the basis of an\ni.i.d. training sample from the joint distribution of $(X,Y)$. Allowable\npredictors are drawn from some specified class, and the goal is to approach\nasymptotically the performance (expected loss) of the best predictor in the\nclass. We consider the setting in which one has perfect observation of the\n$X$-part of the sample, while the $Y$-part has to be communicated at some\nfinite bit rate. The encoding of the $Y$-values is allowed to depend on the\n$X$-values. Under suitable regularity conditions on the admissible predictors,\nthe underlying family of probability distributions and the loss function, we\ngive an information-theoretic characterization of achievable predictor\nperformance in terms of conditional distortion-rate functions. The ideas are\nillustrated on the example of nonparametric regression in Gaussian noise.\n"}
{"title":"Sensor Networks with Random Links: Topology Design for Distributed\n  Consensus","abstract":"  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject\nto:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since\nsensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,\nor communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\ncommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number\nof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and\nalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;\nand, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both\nmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph\ndescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we\nformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a\ncommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to\nwhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive\nnumerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence\nspeed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of\na non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.\n"}
{"title":"Architecture for Pseudo Acausal Evolvable Embedded Systems","abstract":"  Advances in semiconductor technology are contributing to the increasing\ncomplexity in the design of embedded systems. Architectures with novel\ntechniques such as evolvable nature and autonomous behavior have engrossed lot\nof attention. This paper demonstrates conceptually evolvable embedded systems\ncan be characterized basing on acausal nature. It is noted that in acausal\nsystems, future input needs to be known, here we make a mechanism such that the\nsystem predicts the future inputs and exhibits pseudo acausal nature. An\nembedded system that uses theoretical framework of acausality is proposed. Our\nmethod aims at a novel architecture that features the hardware evolability and\nautonomous behavior alongside pseudo acausality. Various aspects of this\narchitecture are discussed in detail along with the limitations.\n"}
{"title":"The on-line shortest path problem under partial monitoring","abstract":"  The on-line shortest path problem is considered under various models of\npartial monitoring. Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights\ncan change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in\neach round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the\nloss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing\nedges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed\nbandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the\nweights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an\nalgorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of\nthe best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by\na quantity that is proportional to 1/\\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on\nthe number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear\ncomplexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension\nto the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision\nmaker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen\npath at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the\ndecision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the\nproblem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit\nsetting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns\nonly the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual\nedges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along\nwith simulation results are also presented.\n"}
{"title":"A neural network approach to ordinal regression","abstract":"  Ordinal regression is an important type of learning, which has properties of\nboth classification and regression. Here we describe a simple and effective\napproach to adapt a traditional neural network to learn ordinal categories. Our\napproach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression.\nOn several benchmark datasets, our method (NNRank) outperforms a neural network\nclassification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods using\nGaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable\nperformance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural\nnetworks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training\ndatasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and\ncomplementary tool for large-scale data processing tasks such as information\nretrieval, web page ranking, collaborative filtering, and protein ranking in\nBioinformatics.\n"}
{"title":"Novel algorithm to calculate hypervolume indicator of Pareto\n  approximation set","abstract":"  Hypervolume indicator is a commonly accepted quality measure for comparing\nPareto approximation set generated by multi-objective optimizers. The best\nknown algorithm to calculate it for $n$ points in $d$-dimensional space has a\nrun time of $O(n^{d/2})$ with special data structures. This paper presents a\nrecursive, vertex-splitting algorithm for calculating the hypervolume indicator\nof a set of $n$ non-comparable points in $d>2$ dimensions. It splits out\nmultiple child hyper-cuboids which can not be dominated by a splitting\nreference point. In special, the splitting reference point is carefully chosen\nto minimize the number of points in the child hyper-cuboids. The complexity\nanalysis shows that the proposed algorithm achieves $O((\\frac{d}{2})^n)$ time\nand $O(dn^2)$ space complexity in the worst case.\n"}
{"title":"A Doubly Distributed Genetic Algorithm for Network Coding","abstract":"  We present a genetic algorithm which is distributed in two novel ways: along\ngenotype and temporal axes. Our algorithm first distributes, for every member\nof the population, a subset of the genotype to each network node, rather than a\nsubset of the population to each. This genotype distribution is shown to offer\na significant gain in running time. Then, for efficient use of the\ncomputational resources in the network, our algorithm divides the candidate\nsolutions into pipelined sets and thus the distribution is in the temporal\ndomain, rather that in the spatial domain. This temporal distribution may lead\nto temporal inconsistency in selection and replacement, however our experiments\nyield better efficiency in terms of the time to convergence without incurring\nsignificant penalties.\n"}
